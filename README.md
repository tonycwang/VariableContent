VariableContent
===============
Sitecore module that allows content editors to create content with one or more placeholders which reference content outside the current field.

Consider the following use cases:
  • Shared content such as company name, copyright information, email address, etc.
  • Dynamic content like copyright date
  • Content passed along in a query string parameter
  • Content stored in a session variable

Additionally, this module was created to be an extensible framework.  So, if you're a developer and you need functionality that isn't offered out-of-the-box, you can add that functionality with relatively little effort.
